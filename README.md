README Summary for Simple Linear Regression
In this task, I implemented Simple Linear Regression using the Boston Housing dataset. I selected 'RM' (average number of rooms) as the independent variable and 'MEDV' (median value of homes) as the target variable. After checking for missing values and splitting the data into training and testing sets, I trained a linear regression model using scikit-learn. I evaluated the model’s performance using MAE, MSE, and R² score, and visualized the fitted regression line against actual data points. Finally, I saved the model’s predictions for further analysis. This exercise helped me understand how a single feature can influence predictions and how to interpret regression coefficients in a real-world dataset.

README Summary for Multiple Linear Regression
In this task, I extended the analysis by implementing Multiple Linear Regression on the Boston Housing dataset. Instead of using only one feature, I selected multiple independent variables — 'RM', 'LSTAT', 'PTRATIO', and 'INDUS' — to predict 'MEDV'. After preprocessing the data and splitting it into training and testing sets, I trained a multiple linear regression model and evaluated it using MAE, MSE, and R² metrics. I also visualized the relationship between actual and predicted values to assess model performance visually. This approach provided deeper insights into how multiple factors together influence the house prices and highlighted the importance of feature selection in regression modeling.
